## About the challenge

In this challenge, the goal was to create a page to view the prices and names of HostGator's plans. The following [layout](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/31631e0c-bd84-4a01-5f67-27878b4deffa-4752/) was used. This [API](https://6dd1804f-a914-4c99-a1ed-58adca2bca74.mock.pstmn.io/prices) was supposed to be used, but it is currently unavailable.
